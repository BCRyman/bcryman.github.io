        <br>
        <p> Hi, I'm Ryan Stevenson, a <strong>Video Game and Software Engineer</strong> based in Plymouth. I am a student at Plymouth University studying <a href="http://www1.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/4230/Pages/CourseOverview.aspx">
          Computing & Games Development</a>. I'm also a <strong>Founder and Chairman</strong> of the <strong>UPSU Game Dev Society</strong> and a <strong>Founder and Developer</strong> of <strong>Blank Canvas Studio</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <p>As a Game Developer I have a keen interest in gaming in both the mainstream scene and indie scene, I also take interest in technology both generally and in the games environment. Outisde of development I like to think I'm a sociable 
        person and enjoy friend gatherings. I find interest in going to the gym and the occasional swim when I can fit them in. Naturally due to the nature of my development I am also an avid gamer, enjoying RPGs and TBS games as well as the 
        occasional adventure and shooter!</p>

                        During the 2nd term of the first year we were introduced to Unity 3D engine. This is the main development kit I use I have a project which is at alpha stage and I am currently working on several other projects on my own and in groups.

                          In our main programming module in the first year we were using C# with the XNA library attached to create a simple game. The game was a hide and seek style game which implemented searching, seeking and random moving AI mechanics, along 
                          with a mechanics for hiding, shooting and moving using the player input.

                          I used stencyl works for the first term of my first year before I was competent enough in C# to start scripting in Unity We were made to use stencyl in order to teach us the development process instead of actually developing games. 
                          This proved useful when I came to make games on Unity. I made an action platformer that was a 2d mix between Super Mario and Luigi's Mansion for my stencyl game.

                         Whilst not really a game development tool, I'm using Bethesda Studios Creation Kit in order to build a level for Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. This is in order to show off my level design skill as opposed to actual game development.

                        C# was the language we were introduced to at the beginning of university and since it has remained my favourite programming language to use. My C# development can be seen through my Unity3D projects and my XNA solutions. After having studied
                        computing at senior school I was able to translate the skills I learnt there in VB over to C#.

                        <p><img src="img/java_logo.png" alt="Java Logo" height="73" width="120"><br><br>
                        In the first term of my second year of university we started using Java for our programming module. Being very syntactically similar to C# I didn't have much trouble picking it up and realising it's potential. We used Java to explore Object-Orientated programming.
                        A method of programming already touched on by our C#.

                        One of the modules of my second year focussed on database development. For this we were introduced to Oracle SQL Developer, I had used some SQL before in my first year but this module really utilized the power of SQL and PL/SQL. Along with 4 of my student colleagues we
                        built a back-end in SQL Developer and a front-end using APEX.

                        My programming journey started in the first year of sixth form with an AS level in computing. The programming language chosen by my school was Visual Basic and it was the first programming language I ever developed in. As with most new programming
                        languages we started with small console based applications whilst learning programming techniques and constructs. Before moving onto form based applications the most challenging console based solution I produced was a game of Battleships.
                        My A2 computing coursework can be seen in my portfolio and was the pinnacle of my Visual Basic development. Looking back on that code now I would love to tear it apart and build it all again with C# however I think it's the best example of
                        my visual basic skill.

                    <p>Last year I was mainly keeping version control by making copies of my work whenever I made changes, these would all be stored on dropbox so I could access them anywhere. This system became very inconvenient and spatially inefficient and so
                     I was introduced by a friend to Git. I started off on the command line however I'm more recently using the GitHub gui for git, as GitHub gives a good student account.

                            When it comes to doing work that postit notes can't manage I use pivotal tracker. Whether it's for my own personal projects or in a group I find it an incredibly useful way to keep track of projects and keep track of who's doing what. 
                            I find pivotal tracker great due to how easy it is to split the problems up into task and give each smaller task a timeframe instead of for the overall problem.

                            I have an app called Wunderlist on my iPad which is a "to-do list" app. I find this useful for when I'm out and about and if I think of something
                             on a project whilst I'm out I can note it down on there and come back to it on the webapp on my pc to then transfer to either postit notes or pivotal!
