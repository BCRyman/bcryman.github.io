        <br>
        <p>At the time of writing it is coming up New Years going into 2015. Last year I fell into the "I'll set some resolutions
          and stick to them!" Routine, only to find myself getting two months in and back into the ways of old. So this year I'm
          approaching it slightly differently, instead of strict resolutions I'm setting some loose rules or guidelines to live by,
          and here they are:</p>
        <br><br>
        <hr>

        <ol>
          <li> Spend at least three sufficient exercise sessions a week.</li>
          <li> Enjoy a diet that doesn't undo rule 1.</li>
          <li> Spend at least three hours of personal Game/Software Development a week.</li>
          <li> Adhere to the work of Epictetus: "It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters."</li>
          <li> Abide by the 4 rules of Ryans01: <a href="http://redd.it/1q96b5">http://redd.it/1q96b5</a></li>
          <li> Attend social events every so often.</li>
          <li> Enjoy Video Games regularly, not just develop them.</li>
          <li> Focus on the things that matter, but also make the most of the little things.</li>
          <li> Learn Italian for a holiday to Rome with my lass.</li>
          <li> Pick up the piano/keyboard again.</li>
        </ol>
