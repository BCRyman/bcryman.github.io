            Leap Arcade shooter is my latest project in development. In a nutshell it's an arcade style shooter where the user aims using the Leap Motion and fires bullets by shouting into a microphone!

            For a module of my second year we are assessed on our design process. For this we're encouraged to build a mod for a previous game. For this I've chosen to make a mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. A thing
            that was wasn't included in Skyrim that was in Oblivion is an arena "colisseum" type area. So this is what I'm going to try and implement using the creation kit!

            <p>Engine: Unity3D<br>
            Language: C#<br>
            Asteroid Escape was my first Unity3D project. Developed in the second term of my first year at Uni it's was inspired
            by Starfox 64 primarily. The player would take control of a spaceship that's flying through an asteroid field and had to get as
            far as they could and eventually be destroyed by Asteroids. <br>
            The game features dynamically generated asteroids that spawn when a player reaches a certain distance forward. There was also plans
            to add power ups to the game when it's in more than an alpha stage. A link to a very stripped down game can be found <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/Hothead1993/project-asteroid-escape-alpha">here!</a>

            <p>Engine: Unity3D<br>
            Language: C#<br>
            Ropes was a project taken up by my house and course mate <a href="http://elliotblackburn.co.uk/">Elliot Blackburn</a> and I as a rapid prototype for one of our second year modules. It's a 2 player adventure puzzle game with a twist. The two players are linked
            together with a rope. This involves verbal communication between players in order to solve the puzzles under the contraints. <br>
            We looked into taking a rope mechanic from the Unity store and implementing it, however this proved unsuccessful and so we set out to develop our own rope mechanic, this, was not easy. We did however manage to complete
            our goal and learnt a lot from it. The blog for this project can be found <a href="http://bcgames.co.uk/category/project-blog/ropes/"> here!</a>

            This project is a group project <a href="http://elliotblackburn.co.uk/">Elliot</a>, myself and <a href="http://bhda.carbonmade.com/">Bejan</a>(Another of our coursemates) took on for a module in our second year. This module involves
            a live client. Our clients project was port a game they'd already built to mobile device. Their game is That's my Jellybean and is shown in the picture. It's a game built in Unity3D and we're currently porting it over to Unity2D!

            Dr Doctor was the first game I ever created. We were asked to use Stencyl to produce a game and from this I produced a small Platform game that takes ideas from Super Mario and Luigis Mansion. You

              This was the first big piece of software I developed, it's a till system developed for my A2 computing project.
              Based off of real till I developed this till so that all the buttons were customizeable and had different functions.
              In order to do this all the menu buttons are generated dynamically and all their information was stored in text files, perhaps not the safest of methods but it was how we 
              were taught at school. The system also held totals for hourly checks and a daily checks as well as a stock control system and a staff hours tracking system which produced 
              a bar chart based on how much a member of staff had worked.
