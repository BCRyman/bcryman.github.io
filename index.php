        <h3 class="text-center">Hello and Welcome!</h3>

        <br>
        <p> Hi, I'm Ryan Stevenson, a <strong>Video Game and Software Engineer</strong> based in Plymouth. I am a student at Plymouth University studying <a href="http://www1.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/4230/Pages/CourseOverview.aspx">
          Computing & Games Development</a>, currently on my Placement Year. I'm also a <strong>Founder and Ex-Chairman</strong> of the <strong>UPSU Game Dev Society</strong> and a <strong>Founder and Developer</strong> of <strong>Blank Canvas Studio</strong>.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>As a Game Developer I have a keen interest in gaming in both the mainstream scene and indie scene, I also take interest in technology both generally and in the games environment. Outisde of development I like to think I'm a sociable
        person and enjoy friend gatherings. I find interest in going to the gym and the occasional swim when I can fit them in. Naturally due to the nature of my development I am also an avid gamer, enjoying RPGs and TBS games as well as the
        occasional adventure and shooter!</p>

                        During the 2nd term of the first year we were introduced to Unity 3D engine. This is the main development kit I use I have a project which is at alpha stage and I am currently working on several other projects on my own and in groups.

                          In our main programming module in the first year we were using C# with the XNA library attached to create a simple game. The game was a hide and seek style game which implemented searching, seeking and random moving AI mechanics, along
                          with a mechanics for hiding, shooting and moving using the player input.

                          I used stencyl works for the first term of my first year before I was competent enough in C# to start scripting in Unity We were made to use stencyl in order to teach us the development process instead of actually developing games.
                          This proved useful when I came to make games on Unity. I made an action platformer that was a 2d mix between Super Mario and Luigi's Mansion for my stencyl game.

                         Whilst not really a game development tool, I'm using Bethesda Studios Creation Kit in order to build a level for Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. This is in order to show off my level design skill as opposed to actual game development.

                        C# was the language we were introduced to at the beginning of university and since it has remained my favourite programming language to use. My C# development can be seen through my Unity3D projects and my XNA solutions. After having studied
                        computing at senior school I was able to translate the skills I learnt there in VB over to C#.

                        In the first term of my second year of university we started using Java for our programming module. Being very syntactically similar to C# I didn't have much trouble picking it up and realising it's potential. We used Java to explore Object-Orientated programming.
                        A method of programming already touched on by our C#.

                        One of the modules of my second year focussed on database development. For this we were introduced to Oracle SQL Developer, I had used some SQL before in my first year but this module really utilized the power of SQL and PL/SQL. Along with 4 of my student colleagues we
                        built a back-end in SQL Developer and a front-end using APEX.

                        My programming journey started in the first year of sixth form with an AS level in computing. The programming language chosen by my school was Visual Basic and it was the first programming language I ever developed in. As with most new programming
                        languages we started with small console based applications whilst learning programming techniques and constructs. Before moving onto form based applications the most challenging console based solution I produced was a game of Battleships.
                        My A2 computing coursework can be seen in my portfolio and was the pinnacle of my Visual Basic development. Looking back on that code now I would love to tear it apart and build it all again with C# however I think it's the best example of
                        my visual basic skill.

                    <p>Last year I was mainly keeping version control by making copies of my work whenever I made changes, these would all be stored on dropbox so I could access them anywhere. This system became very inconvenient and spatially inefficient and so
                     I was introduced by a friend to Git. I started off on the command line however I'm more recently using the GitHub gui for git, as GitHub gives a good student account.

            This is a project I'm undertaking in my free time. Based on a couple of games I've played before; Geometry Dash and the Impossible Game. The player assumes control of a cyber ball and has to make it through spike filled

            A small mobile game I worked on whilst working for Real Visual. The client came to us with the project roughly a year in the works and asked us to add social platform for iOS and the functionality to post screenshots to Facebook.
            After this work was completed we were given more work from our client, I implemented various different systems into the product whilst we worked on it. Such systems include UnityAds, a port to Android, a cross platform store that works
            for both Android and iOS using the Soomla store plugin and general gameplay mechanics and bug fixes.

            For a module of my second year we are assessed on our design process. For this we're encouraged to build a mod for a previous game. For this I've chosen to make a mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. A thing
            that was wasn't included in Skyrim that was in Oblivion is an arena "colisseum" type area. So this is what I'm going to try and implement using the creation kit!

            Asteroid Escape was my first Unity3D project. Developed in the second term of my first year at Uni it's was inspired
            by Starfox 64 primarily. The player would take control of a spaceship that's flying through an asteroid field and had to get as
            far as they could and eventually be destroyed by Asteroids. <br>
            The game features dynamically generated asteroids that spawn when a player reaches a certain distance forward. There was also plans
            to add power ups to the game when it's in more than an alpha stage. A link to a very stripped down game can be found <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/Hothead1993/project-asteroid-escape-alpha">here!</a>
            I do have plans to start this project again now I have a more extensive knowledge of the technology. Watch this space for that!

            Ropes was a project taken up by my house and course mate <a href="http://elliotblackburn.co.uk/">Elliot Blackburn</a> and I as a rapid prototype for one of our second year modules. It's a 2 player adventure puzzle game with a twist. The two players are linked
            together with a rope. This involves verbal communication between players in order to solve the puzzles under the contraints. <br>
            We looked into taking a rope mechanic from the Unity store and implementing it, however this proved unsuccessful and so we set out to develop our own rope mechanic, this, was not easy. We did however manage to complete
            our goal and learnt a lot from it. The blog for this project can be found <a href="http://bcgames.co.uk/category/project-blog/ropes/"> here!</a>

            in which we changed it from a 3D system to using the new Unity 2D tools.

            For the last piece of coursework in our first year programming module we were tasked with making a hide and seek type game. This was built in C# XNA and the idea was to hide from the enemies using the wall and then shoot then by
            returning into view, whilst you were behind the wall only certain types of enemy could find you and when you were outside of the wall all enemies within a certain radius would start to seek you out and end your game.

              This piece of software was built in order to introduce and help us learn programming design patterns, the main one implemented in this piece of software was the obverser design pattern. Developed in Java which gave us a look at
              a fresh new IDE and some slightly different programming styles.

              This was the first big piece of software I developed, it's a till system developed for my A2 computing project.
              Based off of real till I developed this till so that all the buttons were customizeable and had different functions.
              In order to do this all the menu buttons are generated dynamically and all their information was stored in text files, perhaps not the safest of methods but it was how we
              were taught at school. The system also held totals for hourly checks and a daily checks as well as a stock control system and a staff hours tracking system which produced
              a bar chart based on how much a member of staff had worked.
