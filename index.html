          This is a planned project for once CyberJump has been completed, it is a full redesign and development of Asteroid Escape as I've learnt a lot about the Unity engine since I first developed AE. I don't feel my current
          implementation does my idea justice, though I respect the learning curve, I'd like to put a lot more time into it to make it what I feel it can be!

          <p>Engine: Unity3D<br>
          Language: C#<br>
          This is a project I'm undertaking in my free time. Based on a couple of games I've played before; Geometry Dash and the Impossible Game. The player assumes control of a cyber ball and has to make it through spike filled
          levels perfecting precision jumps to get collectables and clear the stages. Target platforms at this time are a web player demo which is hosted <a href="http://www.rystevenson.co.uk/CyberJump.html">here</a> and eventually
          on android which when available you can find <a href="TODO">here</a>.

          Language: C#<br>
          A small mobile game I worked on whilst working for Real Visual. The client came to us with the project roughly a year in the works and asked us to add social platform for iOS and the functionality to post screenshots to Facebook.
          After this work was completed we were given more work from our client, I implemented various different systems into the product whilst we worked on it. Such systems include UnityAds, a port to Android, a cross platform store that works
          for both Android and iOS using the Soomla store plugin and general gameplay mechanics and bug fixes.

          Leap Arcade shooter is my latest project in development. In a nutshell it's an arcade style shooter where the user aims using the Leap Motion and fires bullets by shouting into a microphone!

          Tools: Creation Kit<br>
          For a module of my second year we are assessed on our design process. For this we're encouraged to build a mod for a previous game. For this I've chosen to make a mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. A thing
          that was wasn't included in Skyrim that was in Oblivion is an arena "colisseum" type area. So this is what I'm going to try and implement using the creation kit! The blog for this project can be found <a href="http://blog.rystevenson.co.uk/category/game-development/skyrim-mod/"> here!</a>

        <center><h4>Asteroid Escape</h4></center>
        <p>Engine: Unity3D<br>
        Language: C#<br>
        Asteroid Escape was my first Unity3D project. Developed in the second term of my first year at Uni it's was inspired
        by Starfox 64 primarily. The player would take control of a spaceship that's flying through an asteroid field and had to get as
        far as they could and eventually be destroyed by Asteroids. <br>
        The game features dynamically generated asteroids that spawn when a player reaches a certain distance forward. There was also plans
        to add power ups to the game when it's in more than an alpha stage. A link to a very stripped down game can be found <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/Hothead1993/project-asteroid-escape-alpha">here!</a>
        I do have plans to start this project again now I have a more extensive knowledge of the technology. Watch this space for that!

          <center><h4>Project Ropes</h4></center>
          <p>Engine: Unity3D<br>
          Language: C#<br>
          Ropes was a project taken up by my house and course mate <a href="http://elliotblackburn.co.uk/">Elliot Blackburn</a> and I as a rapid prototype for one of our second year modules. It's a 2 player adventure puzzle game with a twist. The two players are linked
          together with a rope. This involves verbal communication between players in order to solve the puzzles under the contraints. <br>
          We looked into taking a rope mechanic from the Unity store and implementing it, however this proved unsuccessful and so we set out to develop our own rope mechanic, this, was not easy. We did however manage to complete
          our goal and learnt a lot from it. The blog for this project can be found <a href="http://bcgames.co.uk/category/project-blog/ropes/"> here!</a>

          Language: Action Script 3<br>
          Dr Doctor was the first game I ever created. We were asked to use Stencyl to produce a game and from this I produced a small Platform game that takes ideas from Super Mario and Luigis Mansion. You
          play as a minature doctor who has been injected into a human to fight off a deadly virus! The game is currently hosted on Kongregate and can be found <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/Hothead1993/dr-doctor-demo">here!</a>

        <p>Engine: XNA<br>
        Language: C#<br>
        For the last piece of coursework in our first year programming module we were tasked with making a hide and seek type game. This was built in C# XNA and the idea was to hide from the enemies using the wall and then shoot then by
        returning into view, whilst you were behind the wall only certain types of enemy could find you and when you were outside of the wall all enemies within a certain radius would start to seek you out and end your game.

            This piece of software was built in order to introduce and help us learn programming design patterns, the main one implemented in this piece of software was the obverser design pattern. Developed in Java which gave us a look at
            a fresh new IDE and some slightly different programming styles.

            This was the first big piece of software I developed, it's a till system developed for my A2 computing project.
            Based off of real till I developed this till so that all the buttons were customizeable and had different functions.
            In order to do this all the menu buttons are generated dynamically and all their information was stored in text files, perhaps not the safest of methods but it was how we
            were taught at school. The system also held totals for hourly checks and a daily checks as well as a stock control system and a staff hours tracking system which produced
            a bar chart based on how much a member of staff had worked.
